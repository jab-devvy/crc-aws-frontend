                        <p>
                            Hi there! My name is Alex. I've had a fascination with computers and IT as a whole since I was first able to use a Logitech trackball on my Dad's Power Macintosh G3.
-                            I really became interested in IT as a career after reading <a href="https://craphound.com/littlebrother/Cory_Doctorow_-_Little_Brother.pdf">Little Brother</a> by Cory Doctorow in middle school.
-                            It introduced me to Linux and the idea of hacker culture, and I promptly worked for months trying to defeat my school's locked down boot menu so that I could load an Ubuntu live CD and play games or something.
-                            I unfortunately was never able to accomplish this, or install the same CD onto my Mom's old iBook (I had yet to understand CPU architecture). Following this, 
-                            I took what were ultimately four very formative IT classes in high school (thanks Mr. Tokar!), and I've been hooked ever since. I have yet to have held an 'official' help desk or system admin position,
-                            but have somehow managed to apply my knowledge in pretty much every job I've had in some way.<br>
-                            My other interests/hobbies include music, animation, and looking at cool creatures I come across on walks.
